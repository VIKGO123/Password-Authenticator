# Password-Authenticator
Designing Password Authenticator using File Handling and Linked List
This is just a basic form of password authenticator where i have used
File Handling in order to store Password given by the user along with 
a system generated random backup key,on the time of login the entries 
from file will be loaded on the linked list and using linear search his 
authentication of password is matched will password was wrong we give a
chance to enter backup key three times if the user fails in all three
attempts his account will be blocked.
